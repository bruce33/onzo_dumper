					Post by: <b>KenB</b> on <b>November 12, 2010, 04:28:10 PM</b>
					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Any customer of Scottish and Southern Energy can now get a free Onzo Smart Energy Kit. Available to customers across all their regions including, Southern, SWALEC and Scottish Hydro.<br /><br />SSE have rolled out their &quot;iPlan&quot; tariff which is the same price as their standard tariff but includes a free Onzo - worth about £75.<br /><br />As a Southern Electric customer on standard tariff, a quick call got me registered on iPlan and the Onzo landed on the doormat with a thump a few days later.<br /><br />Some of you will know that I spent about a year working for Onzo on the electronics development of this product - and whilst I have moved onto pastures new, it is good to see the product finally get into the public arena.<br /><br />How does it differ from other electricity monitors? &nbsp;Well for a start it takes true power measurements once per second, which leads to a much finer time resolution than other competitors units. It has a large capacity flash RAM in both the sensor and the display, and a copy of your consumption data logs is maintained in both halves. &nbsp;If the wireless link is interrupted - you won&#039;t lose data. &nbsp;<br /><br />The clamp on current sensor uses a technique called power harvesting to keep it powered. &nbsp;It runs continuously from a small rechargeable battery which is constantly being trickle charged. It doesn&#039;t need those clunky D-cells that some sensor units use.<br /><br />Likewise with the display - it is fitted with rechargeable cells and will run for about a month before it needs recharging - this is easily done from the USB port on a computer, when you upload data to your own personal energy monitor dashboard on the iPlan site.<br /><br />I believe you can also buy an Onzo Smart Energy Kit from Amazon. Apparently £20 discount if you quote a certain reference - see OnzoHQ on Twitter for details.&nbsp; That&#039;s enough trumpet blowing for now - I need to start hacking the sensor so that it will count gas pulses.<br /><br />Here&#039;s&nbsp;the display working &quot;straight out of the box&quot; and in the next post because of image size limitations, the sensor clamped to my meter tail. <br /><br />Ken</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Here&#039;s the sensor.&nbsp; Despite lots of communications with the plastics company about pantone colours, the Polish manufacturers have still managed to misinterpret the SSE colours as &quot;snot green&quot;.&nbsp; Nevermind - so long as my part in the electronics bear up to the test of time.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Ted,<br /><br />It&#039;s a 433MHz link with a transceiver at either end.&nbsp; That allows the display to prompt the sensor for any missing data.<br /><br />I&#039;ve just discovered a neat 5V USB mains adaptor lurking in the outer packaging sleeve.&nbsp; It was talked about when I was at Onzo, but as an optional extra&nbsp; - looks like there is one being shipped with every unit.<br /><br />Its good to see a product that you worked on find it&#039;s way in the outside world. Both the Onzo Smart Energy Kit and the trueCall Smart Answering machine I worked on&nbsp; have been shortlisted for &quot;Product of the Year&quot;.<br /><br /><br />Ken</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well done Ken.&nbsp; It looks as though it will do more than my Efergy meter.<br /><br />Npower also gave me a freebie.&nbsp; Pretty useless.&nbsp; The display has to be plugged into the mains to display and its minimum reading is 0.050kW.&nbsp; I have it connected to my solar and it lets me see at a quick glance how much it is producing.&nbsp; However it integrates the 0.050kW throughout the night and always shows a bit more than my generation meter.&nbsp; Sometimes it looks as though I have generated at least a kWh during the day but when I look at the generation meter it shows 0 or 0.1.<br /><br />John</div>

					<hr />
					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Roscoe,<br /><br />The clamp-on sensor has a secondary sensor which picks up the phase of the voltage.<br /><br />Once you know the relationship between phase of the voltage and the current you can accurately calculate power factor.<br /><br />Voltage fluctuations are a little harder to handle - but this is only a domestic monitor, it&#039;s not being used for billing purposes.<br /><br /><br /><br />Ken</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi,<br />I&#039;m new&nbsp; here ... only really found the site because I was searching for anything on the new SE Onzo meter. We have had it for just over 7 days now and whilst it is quite impressive in terms of responsiveness and clarity I&#039;m not so impressed with the SE website it uploads the data to. Yes it does give you a plot per day BUT the scale is tiny so any detailed interpretation is impossible. I will start asking SE if they can assist with this but I was wondering if anyone here has sussed out a way to get access to the data that is uploaded to the website. Surely there must be a way to get it onto Excel or something similar. <br /><br />This data could be really useful but not in its current form.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Chippie40</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hello, I just signed up to add my 2p worth on the onzo monitor :)<br />I signed up to the swalec iplan and got sent an onzo meter about 7 weeks ago, and my first impression is its a nice bit of kit.<br />However in the intervening 7 weeks I have arrived at the opinion im glad i didnt pay for it.<br />The meter clamp seems prone to buzzing, this isnt the end of the world but it would be nice if the design of the clamp allowed you to clamp it tight enough that it wasnt an issue.<br />The Energy display seems to have an occasional fit going into a reboot loop causing it to reboot every few minutes, and the associated bing bong from my PC as the usb disconnects/reconnects, I havent worked out the cause of this and it might just be a fault with my display, but its random and intermittent nature makes me think its a firmware bug. <br />Both of these I could probably live with, but the real problem i have with this device is that I am not the intended customer for this device, it isnt mine, it is for the benefit of the power company and power company alone.<br />The communication protocols and data storage are proprietary and designed to funnel your usage data to swalec for them to use, you do get pretty graphs on their site when its working but you get no access to the raw data for you to use as you wish.<br />Dont get me wrong, swalec gave me this for free in return for getting my usage data fed back to them and I have no problem with that tradeoff, however I would also like a copy of this data to use as I see fit.<br />Unfortunately the device appears to be being used to lock you in to swalecs services as if you move to another provider your online graphs will cease to work, it might be possible to convert a swalec onzo into an onzo onzo to get the online functionality back, but that isnt what I want in a product.<br /><br />If i was to buy a power meter I think i would be looking at the offerings from currentcost they may not be as technically advanced, but at least you are the customer and you get to use the data they produce however you see fit.<br />en4rab</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Today is the first chance I&#039;ve had to check the Onzo&#039;s reading while we have been exporting.<br /><br />Unfortunately it seems that the Onzo treats export the same as import and simply gives a positive number, thereby adding the export to the daily kWh consumption figure.<br /><br />So it is going to be of little or no use to anyone with on-site renewables.</div>

As long as you are a &#039;consumer&#039; and not a business the Distance Selling Regulations (see http://www.oft.gov.uk/about-the-oft/legal-powers/legal/distance-selling-regulations/) mean that any such clause is ineffective.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Thanks All,<br /><br />I spoke this morning to the people at Onzo, apparantly &quot;My Onzo&quot; should be up &amp; running on the 31st Jan testing allowing..<br /><br />As to the Issue a few have had with Batteries, if you look at the facebook page there&#039;s a back off shot, so reassurances there that battery pack failure out of warranty can be obtained easily via maplin &amp; the like.<br /><br />With regard to the energy supplier software vs open software / utility supplier uploads, &quot;My Onzo&quot; should address this by means of subscription to further software you can buy into&nbsp; so that should help with those who unwittingly find themselveswith a utility supplied ONzo if purchased via ebay &amp; the like.<br />Apparantly Onzo themselves pulled out from ebay as a sales outlet.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have a couple of questions.<br /><br />1) I use Linux, and the Onzo doesn&#039;t come with a Linux driver, before I start trying to hack the thing to make it work I wondered if anybody knew exactly how the USB comms work, and what kind of device the Onzo presents itself as. I suspect it is a glorified serial port, HID or a mass storage device, or some combination of all three.<br /><br />2) My Onzo device is supplied by Scottish Power, but I would like access to the data which no doubt I could do by &quot;screen scraping&quot; the Scottish Power Onzo portal, (even if that means setting up a VM running Windows to get round the lack of Linux drivers). Is there any way to make the device report to a website other than the one it comes preconfigured to talk to?<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Also you can run the onzo uploader with a --debug parameter, If you can access a windows machine just temporarily to play with it it seems to basically dump all the usb packets into a file.<br />Once installed the onzo uploader application will be in &quot;C:\Users\name\AppData\Local\Onzo\Onzo Uploader&quot; where name is your login name, well that where it is on my win7 box, youll have to turn off the hide hidden folders thing i think as Appdata is hidden.<br />When run with --debug it creates a file &quot;uploader.log&quot; full of stuff, the interesting bit is it seems to print all the usb packets like this trimmed example:<br /><br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">INFO Upload start<br />INFO Session: {session id would be here}<br />DEBUG ONZO_DisplayWrite(&#039; 01 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 92 9C 02 00 01 2D FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF&#039;)<br />DEBUG ONZO_DisplayCallback(&#039; 01 12 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 92 9C 02 00 01 2D 4F 15 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00&#039;)<br /></div><br />In the above line what i think is happening is the software is querying the display to ask it what its firmware version is, i *think* it breaks down something like this:<br />01 &gt; Seems to be a flag indicating if the message is split across packets 00 = more data to come 01 = last or only packet in message <br />10 &gt; packet length<br />00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 &gt; padding<br />92 9C &gt; 16bit random transfer ID, same number is used for response<br />02 00&gt; this is the device the request is for 00 02 == display 00 01 == sensor sent as wrong endian <br />01 &gt; get register (see below)<br />2D &gt; register to get (from firmware.txt this appears to be decimal 45, &quot;FIRMWARE_VERSION = 45&quot;<br />The response is similarly structured only with firmware version appended and different length byte, if i read it right i have firmware 4F 15 which i think should be interpreted as 79 21 in decimal, bit its hard to tell, the decompile source numbers the registers in decimal which makes my head hurt.<br /><br />Anyway that might all be wrong, however in the usbprotocol directory of the unpacked driver the utils.pyo gives:<br />REQUEST_GET_REGISTER = 1<br />REQUEST_SET_REGISTER = 2<br />REQUEST_GET_BULK_DATA = 3<br />REQUEST_GET_NETWORK_LIST = 4<br />REQUEST_CMD_RESET = 5<br />REQUEST_LDM_COMMAND = 160<br />RESPONSE_GET_REGISTER = 1<br />RESPONSE_SET_REGISTER = 2<br />RESPONSE_GET_BULK_DATA = 3<br />RESPONSE_GET_NETWORK_LIST = 4<br />RESPONSE_LDM_COMMAND = 160<br />RESPONSE_ERROR = 240<br />RESPONSE_END_OF_TRANSFER = 241<br /><br />I hope this info helps, oh and whatever firmware this is running its the one that makes it reboot all the time :)</div>

Usually they operate on 435MHz so a simple 1/2 wave dipole at around 330mm long connected by a thin piece of co-ax makes the wireless link &quot;bomb proof&quot;. I modified a friends current cost envi unit and he can pick up the clamp signal in his house when the clamp is on the output of his inverter in an outbuilding some 25m away.

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I have been doing a little more looking at the onzo_uploader software, just incase anybody is interested I have managed to unpack and run the unpacked python and am currently working on getting pyREtic working. Here is what i have done so far:<br />The uploader software is an executable created using py2exe, this bundles a python interpreter and all the python files zipped up into a single executable.<br />7zip can extract the python files fine but if you want to extract the zip manually (or reinsert a patched zip back into the executable) you can identify where the embedded zip file starts by opening the application in a hex editor and searching for the <b>second</b> instance of the hex string &quot;504B0304&quot; what you should see is this:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">Offset&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 3&nbsp; 4&nbsp; 5&nbsp; 6&nbsp; 7&nbsp; &nbsp;8&nbsp; 9&nbsp;

to change the file extention of all the pyo files to pyc<br />Now running start.py succeeded and the uploader app appeared on my screen.<br /><br /><b>Making pyREtic work</b><br />This has proved challenging as im not a coder, dont know python, and the app appears to have been exclusively developed on linux so has a few bugs under windows :)<br />Download pyREtic from here: http://code.google.com/p/pyretic/<br />I extracted this, renamed the folder containing pyretic.py to pyREtic instead of pyREtic_0.5.1, and then copied this folder into the C:\onzo directory<br />Following the instructions in HOWTO.txt (its in the Docs directory) i changed the start.py to launch pyretic before launching the onzo app like so:<br /><div class="codeheader">Code:</div><div class="code">import sys, os<br />sys.path.append(os.path.join(&quot;.&quot;, &quot;pyREtic&quot;, &quot;onzo&quot;))<br />from client import ui<br />from pyREtic import REpdb<br />REpdb.set_trace()<br />ui.main()</div><br />Trying to run this threw errors about creating folders that already existed and left me stuck, after much head scratching I discovered that since pyretic was written under linux the error messages are slightly different so you need to edit the pyREtic.py file on line 73 it says:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; if &quot;Errno 17&quot; not in str(err):<br />This doesnt work under windows, you need to change Errno to Error like so:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; if &quot;Error 17&quot; not in str(err):<br /><br />Now pyretic should work, run the start.py &quot;python start.py&quot; and you should be presented with the pyretic command shell,<br />first i set the project with the command &quot;set_project&quot;, tell it to use python 2.5 and call the project onzo and download the python files it wants<br />with that done running the command &quot;fs_um_decompile C:\onzo&quot; should start id decompiling and scrolling loads of stuff up the screen.<br />Once its done you should have something close to resembleing the source for each .pyc in a .py file of the same name.<br /><br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I knew id forget something!<br />In order to make the unpacked client run properly you also have to copy the &quot;OnzoDisplayClientLibrary.dll&quot; to the C:\onzo directory or it will bomb out when you try to start the client.<br />A quicker way to rename all the .pyo files is the entering the following command when inthe onzo directory:<br />&quot;for /r %x in (*.pyo) do ren &quot;%x&quot; *.pyc&quot;<br /><br />Secondly once you have run pyretic the fact it outputs the decompiled .py files into the same directory as the .pyc files will stop the unpacked application from working as the decompiled files are not 100% correct, i would suggest having 2 directorys one for investigating the running software and a second copy for decompiling, pyretic should output files to a seperate subdirectory but this seems to be broken and i havent tried to investigate this.<br /><br />Another file that caught my eye was devicetool.pyo, this appears to be a debugging tool allowing you to poke the display, from decompilig it seems it accepts the following arguments:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parser.add_option(&#039;--firmware&#039;, &#039;action&#039;=&#039;store&#039;, &#039;dest&#039;=&#039;firmware&#039;, &#039;help&#039;=&#039;upgrade firmware (device must be in bootloader mode)&#039;)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parser.add_option(&#039;--test&#039;, &#039;action&#039;=&#039;store_true&#039;, &#039;dest&#039;=&#039;testsuite&#039;, &#039;help&#039;=&#039;run full test suite&#039;)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parser.add_option(&#039;--retrieve&#039;, &#039;action&#039;=&#039;store_true&#039;, &#039;dest&#039;=&#039;testretrieve&#039;, &#039;help&#039;=&#039;continously retrieve data&#039;)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parser.add_option(&#039;--bug165&#039;, &#039;action&#039;=&#039;store_true&#039;, &#039;dest&#039;=&#039;bug165&#039;, &#039;help&#039;=&#039;test bug165&#039;)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parser.add_option(&#039;--bug169&#039;, &#039;action&#039;=&#039;store_true&#039;, &#039;dest&#039;=&#039;bug169&#039;, &#039;help&#039;=&#039;test bug169&#039;)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parser.add_option(&#039;--bug168&#039;, &#039;action&#039;=&#039;store_true&#039;, &#039;dest&#039;=&#039;bug168&#039;, &#039;help&#039;=&#039;test bug168&#039;)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parser.add_option(&#039;--blocktransfer&#039;, &#039;action&#039;=&#039;store&#039;, &#039;dest&#039;=&#039;blocktransfer&#039;, &#039;help&#039;=&#039;Receive all used blocks for specified data_type&#039;)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parser.add_option(&#039;-r&#039;, &#039;--request&#039;, &#039;action&#039;=&#039;store&#039;, &#039;dest&#039;=&#039;request&#039;, &#039;default&#039;=&#039;0x01&#039;, &#039;help&#039;=&#039;register_id (default is %default)&#039;)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parser.add_option(&#039;-d&#039;, &#039;--data_type&#039;, &#039;action&#039;=&#039;store&#039;, &#039;dest&#039;=&#039;data_type&#039;, &#039;default&#039;=&#039;0x01&#039;, &#039;help&#039;=&#039;register_id or data_type (default is %default)&#039;)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parser.add_option(&#039;-n&#039;, &#039;--network&#039;, &#039;action&#039;=&#039;store&#039;, &#039;dest&#039;=&#039;network&#039;, &#039;default&#039;=&#039;0x02&#039;, &#039;help&#039;=&#039;network_id (default is %default)&#039;)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parser.add_option(&#039;-t&#039;, &#039;--transaction&#039;, &#039;action&#039;=&#039;store&#039;, &#039;dest&#039;=&#039;transaction&#039;, &#039;default&#039;=&#039;0xDEAD&#039;, &#039;help&#039;=&#039;network_id (default is %default)&#039;)</div><br />I havent been able to get all of these to work, but running it without arguments gives the following output:<br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">C:\onzo&gt;python devicetool.pyc<br />2011-06-02 18:57:04,923 device&nbsp;

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I noticed today for quite a long time the display showing ---- rather than live data.<br /><br />As my load has been low I wondered if the battery pack in the transmitter was actually being charged properly or had run down...<br /><br />Time to open up the transmitter :)<br /><br />(http://i336.photobucket.com/albums/n359/IM35461/Onzo/2011-06-17162804.jpg)<br /><br />You will see the battery pack is like the one in the display unit but is made out of rechargeable alkaline AAA&#039;s and just has one screw on the battery cover.<br /><br />And like the display it would seem you can fit three normal alkaline AAA&#039;s<br /><br />Anyway, checking the battery pack I get 4.80volts so for a 4.5volt battery pack I would say it is ok.<br /><br />Pairing was not lost while the battery was out but today&#039;s energy figure starts off again at zero.<br /><br />Automan.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">I&#039;m a SWALEC customer, we&#039;ve had our ONZO since the last week in May. &nbsp;<br /><br />Here are my experiences so far:-<br /><br />Very pleased with the device initially. &nbsp;It exposed the inefficiency of a number of household appliances, most notably old-style fluorescent tube lighting and my desktop PC. &nbsp;The desktop PC was cured somewhat - during my initial rather zealous Onzo monitoring, trying to nail down that last 30W of usage that would not go away, I turned off the main switch at the fuse box; &nbsp;the resultant surge when I turned it back on (yes the PC was previously powered off and connected via a supposedly anti-surge adaptor) finished off the old PC power supply good and proper. &nbsp;A new &quot;greener&quot; one has replaced it, but it&#039;s still quite greedy compared to the laptop.<br /><br />The USB charger was a very tight fit in the mains socket; Last month SWALEC sent out a new USB charger to all customers, apparently there had been issues with them being so tight that the 3-pin mains pin part physically separated from the body, leaving live mains exposed. &nbsp;They also sent a reply paid envelope so that the defective one could be returned to them.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago I noticed that the battery was running down quite quickly; &nbsp; By yesterday it was running down within half a day. &nbsp;Often the unit would lose its connection with the sender and I&#039;d have to re-pair them when this happened.<br />I contacted SWALEC and received this reply:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader">Quote</div><div class="quote">I am sorry to hear of the problems you have experienced with the Onzo device.<br /><br />Unfortunately this does appear to be fault which has affected a few of our Iplan customers. We have been experiencing some problems with our Iplan battery packs recently and we have released a new firmware to fix these problems.<br /><br />Rather than just sending a new battery I have arranged for a new device to be sent out to you and this device will have the new firmware on which will hopefully prevent this problem from happening again. You should receive this within the next 14 working days. Please note that you should receive two Iplan packs. One will be containing the device and sensor and you will receive another pack with the USB charger in.</div><br />I agree with the other posters, it would be nice to be able to get at the raw data eg. as a spreadsheet. &nbsp;I notice on the SWALEC flash usage bar-chart there&#039;s an issue, the last day of each month is always empty. &nbsp;No bar for 31st August, 31st July, 30th June etc...<br /><br />These problems aside, I&#039;m still very happy with the device (it was free, after all) and the service/support from SWALEC. &nbsp; We&#039;re much more aware of our wasteful ways and seem to be on target to same 10% over the year. &nbsp; Not sure that we will save any money after the price hikes, but...<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">update..<br /><br />I received my new Onzo this morning a nice Jaffa Orange one to replace the snot green one&nbsp; ...bright, won&#039;t get lost too often as it travels around checking consumption&nbsp; (as you do).<br /><br />The Support I&#039;ve received alone makes it worthy of the £79.95 price.<br />Good to know you can speak to support &amp; uk based designers at this stage in Onzo evolution if you have a problem.<br />They seem completely transparent &amp; open to to improvements by means of the my onzo forum, software upgrades seem to appear regularly.<br /><br />The longer you have the unit connected the more is available, unlike a lot of &quot;innovations&quot; this one doesn&#039;t rest on it&#039;s laurels.<br /><br />very commendable unit &amp; company!<br /><br />All in all it is&nbsp; turning our consumption around WILLINGLY!<br />As a non tecchy type I love this unit for it&#039;s simplicity, even grandma could use it unlike the fiddly owl<br />(the owl was our &quot;gateway unit&quot; into monitoring)<br />If you wan&#039;t a unit the whole family can benefit from (no electronics degree required) I&#039;d highly recommend this as an all rounder.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">On the whole I like my Onzo.<br /><br />I have a few gripes however.<br /><br />Firstly, it underreads.&nbsp; I am not sure by how much, but my Onzo measured consumption has only been one or two kWhs below my import all through the summer and I cannot believe that I am exporting that little.&nbsp; I shall get a better estimate in the dim days of December when PV production is at a minimum.<br /><br />Secondly, it gives minimal history other than its graphical web displays which are only to the nearest kW per day.&nbsp; I get round this by setting the unit cost to 10p and thus the last week&#039;s cost on the unit tells me the number of units used.&nbsp; Web totals are based on last 7 days not calendar weeks so are not much use.&nbsp; At least my Efergy unit displays calendar weekly and monthly totals, although I have had to incorrectly set the date so that its week corresponds to Onzo&#039;s monday to sunday week and my meter reading time of late on sunday evenings.<br /><br />John</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">John, why not add it to the suggestions on the forum?<br />I&#039;d find a set pattern week handy too, &amp; surely they could get round that in their software algorithms without much trouble?<br />As I recall, Onzo runs to +/- 5% accuracy generally the kit is an estimation / guideline not a nailed down amount, the fact that it adjusts every second is way better for readings compared to my owl&#039;s updates every 5 seconds? that instantaneous reaction to load makes it far more worthwhile imho, can&#039;t wait to see their dual fuel unit come to light.</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi all ,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;New to this site , found it while trawling around to find about replacing the battery pack on my Onzo - I&#039;m no longer with SE whom I got it from via I-plan . <br />Firstly I must say that this was the hardest registration I&#039;ve ever had to do on the web , I can never read those wibbly wobbly letter things :0) .<br /><br />But onto the Onzo , 1 question and one bit of info.<br /><br />Question: Does anyone know where I can get hold of the battery type that is in the main meter part of the onzo , ? The +ve end is flat rather than a raised nobbly bit.<br /><br />Info: I&#039;ve seen people asking about putting the data onto excel which I too would like to do , it strikes me that currently the Onzo is designed more for the advantage of the electric Co&#039;s than the individual given that it gives them a huge database of usage! or am I just being cynical?<br /><br />Amyway with that in mind I emailed Onzo a couple of days ago and recieved a reply saying that later this year the ability to use the info yourself should become available.<br /><br />This is what I got:<br /><br /><b>Currently its not possible for you to transfer your data to an excel spreadsheet, however our lovely tech team are currently working on this feature, which will hopefully be released later this year.<br /><br /><br />We will of course be in touch once this feature is available.</b><br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Dames</div>

If you were thinking of trying to make your own pack to replace the existing one, then you know they are rechargeable alkalines? Does it matter whether the cells have got a nobbly +ve end or not? Don&#039;t know what would happen if you made a pack out of some other kind of rechargeable, but I don&#039;t expect it would be good - not designed to charge other kinds appropriately! You know that it&#039;s also designed to run solely off USB power (no battery pack inserted, e.g. use a USB charger), though makes makes it less easy to move it around. And also designed to run off ordinary alkaline batteries (not made into a pack, no &#039;flying lead&#039;). If you want to risk further experiments, then using separate rechargeable alkaline cells and removing them to charge yourself when needed might work. Ditto NiCd or NiMh, though these would supply less voltage to start with so might not last as long, if they work at all (a bit like me trying NiMh in my GPS, which takes 4 x AA - at only 1.2V per cell, they are barely above the operating voltage to start with - 5 * NiMh would be ideal if they&#039;d fit inside!).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">As above, Onzo will probably replace them. &nbsp;They have had errors with batteries and replaced mine FOC.<br /><br />Onzos are good but not perfect. &nbsp;Their downloaded display gives consumption to the nearest kWh only and no calendar week or clendar month totals.<br /><br />However they do give a week to date (start 0001 monday morning to 2359 sunday evening) and one previous week&#039;s monetary total. &nbsp;I set mine at 10p a unit so I can easily convert the monetary total to a kWh total.<br /><br />My Onzo underreads by about 15%.<br /><br />John</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Mick, Yes I do, I got hold of my Onzo today via eBay today, and I am interested in analyzing the data stream. I had started a Java project to analyse the data from an Owl-160, but I had to abandon this because the resolution of the data wasn&#039;t fine enough to determine which devices were turning on or off. The problem is the consumption is averaged over the period (1 minute) this leads to many problems with transitions and multiple devices being turned on or off during the same period. These problems should be greatly lessened with a 1 second granularity. I would be interested in anything which could get the data stream for a period (like 24 hours) into a .csv file or DB for further analysis. I am not a Southern Electric consumer so I can&#039;t use the iplan server facilities, But I do have the Onzo loader S/W, and it is connecting successfully to the device, but I can&#039;t get further than a request to enter my account number (which of course I don&#039;t have)<br />Graham</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">A bit of a tease, these were done with a very very manual method not with some super secret app that hasnt been released but is0_mick is working on that :)<br />But it looks like we have got the logged power data understood the top picture is a comparison between the 3 streams the display logs for power (POWER_REAL_STANDARD,POWER_REAL_FINE and POWER_REACTIVE_STANDARD) and the same data displayed on swalec&#039;s website. The bottom image is the same data but with POWER_REAL_STANDARD and POWER_REAL_FINE merged into one trace which is i think what they do in swalecs backend.<br />The reactive power isnt displayed on swalecs graphs but i believe is used or was intended to be used in helping to fingerprint devices as it will give a measure of the total amount of capacitance or inductance of the load, i havent verified i decoded it correctly either so it might be nonsense.<br />The timestamps on the x axis are as read from the Onzo, they appear to be utterly retarded in that it is just a counter that counts the seconds since the clamp was powered (ie it behaves as a timestamp with a random epoch depending on when you got or last changed the batterys of your onzo clamp) up so you have to do some messing to convert it to a real time (get the current timestamp from the clamp, subtract it from the current unix timestamp then add on the timestamp for the point you are interested in and convert into human readable time) smartypants bonus if you can tell me when I first connected this onzo :)<br />(http://i.imgur.com/RK2tOc1.png)<br />(http://i.imgur.com/un4hCUw.png)</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">en4rab,<br />Two years 155 days ago at approximately 6:46pm + 40 seconds. I can&#039;t be bothered to do the calendar date&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />It&#039;s good that the device measures reactive power, that helps with identifying devices, the owl was much less capable (at least using the data extracted by spreadsheet from the application). Please can you post a sample with a finer x-axis i.e. showing the individual samples for a minute or two when something is happening. That would help me to work out what is going on. By the way there are a lot of academic papers on disaggregation, some of them with really horrible maths in them. There are also a couple of doctorate students working on it, one at Imperial London, one at Southampton. I think with a bit of local knowledge about what was happening it would be possible to train appliance recognition, but first any help with getting the data out my Onzo would be much appreciated. Also If there is anything I can contribute please let me know.<br />Graham</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Mick, Thanks for the speedy response<br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s just sporadic, I think this is data compression, i.e. don&#039;t output a value that doesn&#039;t change.<br /><br />So are there just three types of sample - standard, fine &amp; reactive or are their others? Which type is the data in your spreadsheet?<br /><br />I guess if the disagggregation isn&#039;t going to miss something useful, what&#039;s needed is a set of rows of data for a given period, which looks a bit like<br /><br />&lt;timestamp&gt;, &lt;sample type1&gt;,&lt;sample type2&gt;,.....&lt;sample type n&gt;<br /><br />I am not clear what the difference is between fine and standard, is it the time granularity? if so what are the grain sizes &#039;n&#039; secs and 1 sec or something different?<br /><br />Regards<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Graham</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Hi Mick<br />I have had a closer look at your data (4-power_real_fine) using Excel , I still think what is going on is compression, but the pairs of values could be explained by slight coding error in the device and if the power is recorded with a finer granularity than 1 watt, this could happen if you check readings are the different by rounding to nearest integer then comparing, then rounding down the figures for transmission 5.1 &amp; 5.9 round to 5 &amp; 6 but round down to 5 and 5.<br /><br />On a different subject, there are still some slight differences in value due to the power on or off being at different times within the second being measured, look in your data on the 8th Nov at the readings for the 6th and 7th minute past midnight. This looks like a fridge cycling &quot;on&quot; for 2-8 seconds at a time, the difference between the &quot;on&quot; bar heights is probably the transition effect when it turns on or off, when the granularity is a minute this really screws things up, but with this data it&#039;s a much smaller problem.<br />Graham</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Mick,<br />I have now had a look at your reactive power readings &amp; I have a question, do the timestamps line up the various sets of readings? I have compared data sets 4 Power real fine and 5 power reactive standard for the first 10 minutes of the 8th of November. It doesn&#039;t make much sense, I don&#039;t understand the gaps in the reactive power readings see snippet below<br />Date&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Day&nbsp; &nbsp;Hour&nbsp; Min&nbsp; &nbsp; Sec&nbsp; &nbsp; R-Power<br />8 November 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;121<br />8 November 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-349<br />8 November 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-349<br />8 November 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-281<br />8 November 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67<br />8 November 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;36&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;72<br />8 November 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;174<br />8 November 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;184<br />8 November 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;134<br />8 November 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;47&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;170<br />8 November 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185<br />8 November 2013&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;159<br /><br />the real power has a spike at 0:2:16 and a plateau from then until 0:3:38 then back to background levels, this plateau does correspond when most of the reactive readings are taken - so maybe it does make sense with a motor turning on for 82 second, the spike would be the peak in-rush current. in which case the background saw-tooth pattern isn&#039;t the fridge&nbsp; :o This might make more sense. In fact taking a step back and looking at the first 6 hours of the 8th the approx. 1100 watt spike only happens twice more at 04:20:27 and 05:59:36. This is where knowing what appliances are connected aids interpretation. However it does look like plotting real and reactive power clusters could be useful.<br /><br />It&#039;s useful to understand the background noise, then it can be subtracted leaving a cleaner signal for further interpretation.<br /><br />Graham<br /></div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">You can&#039;t identify based only on reactive power, but that with the power measurement gives a better fingerprint, and can indicate there is a motor or similar device involved. For an effective solution you would need a DB of fingerprints and a program that could disaggregate the power usage to match the fingerprints. It would be possible to build a DB of fingerprints for your own home by turning devices on and off individually (I simplify somewhat!), a general soultion would need a lot of consumers collaborating or the manufacturers to supply fingerprints to an industry standard (if such a thing exists).</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Bit of a thread resurrection but i&#039;m hoping at least someone still uses the Onzo electricity monitors? Anyhow I&#039;ve just bought a &quot;new&quot; one from ebay and reading about all the battery leak issues I will recycle the supplied battery packs. <br /><br />So to replace the transmitter batteries do these need to be replaced with rechargeable (ni-mh) AAA&#039;s or standard alkaline? I recall reading something about trickle charging the pack from the power cable?<br /><br />Also interested to read that I can output the data to my server which is handy,<br /><br />thanks!<br /></div>

Short version is a guy in our Makerspace works for an energy company, and they need to dump them. We would like to use them in our community, but haven&#039;t had much luck getting data out of them yet. Did anyone end up publishing code the code that you were using to dump these readers? If so, would you mind sharing?

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;">Well, seven years late to the party, but just received a nice £7 orange Onzo from ebay!<br /><br />The ebay seller had sadly removed the sensors rechargeable battery pack and the 5V USB mains adaptor, but left the rechargeable pack in the display unit.<br />Though it&#039;s nice to see some homebrew software to pull data from the display unit, I&#039;m approaching this from the RF side, and hope to decode the signals sent from the sensor itself using a cheap USB &#039;DVB&#039; software defined radio.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen comments that the Onzo might be using Zigbee, but that can&#039;t be the case as the frequency in use is 433MHz.<br />I wonder what the modulation is, OOK?, FSK?</div>

					<div style="margin: 0 5ex;"><br />I realize this is a very old thread but these meters are now being sold for £6 on ebay so I have purchased one. My plan is to use two, one for my import and one for the output of my solar farm! with the intention of collecting and retaining the data myself. This seems a lot cheaper than the emonpi (£170!) I see that there is an uploader (dump) https://www.en4rab.co.uk/onzo/ (https://www.en4rab.co.uk/onzo/) tool that is built with python for windows. This appears to work. <br /><br />I have tried to get this to run on my (preferred) system which is linux without luck. Running it using wine fails and if I try to run it as a native python app it falls over looking for a so file (OnzoPyDisplays.so.1.0.0).&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I know enough (to be dangerous) that this is a compiled library file and as such I would need the appropriate library for my system so I guess I have a few questions. Does anyone know of a version of this app that would run natively on on linux, or where I could get a copy of the appropriate so library file or finally how I would go about compiling one myself.<br /><br />Many thanks,<br /><br /><br />Pete.</div>
